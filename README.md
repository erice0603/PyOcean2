PyOcean is a plug-in for Petrel allowing integration between Schlumberger Petrel suite and Python modules.
This enables synergy and re-use of corporate Python libraries, as well as bridge-building to other databases, softwares and tools.

PyOcean features an Object Dropper to represent Petrel objects as a Python variable. Currently PyOcean is undergoing testing before being released commercially.
